This is a read me file for setup

This file will not only handle all configuration setings set in config/config.xml,
it will also, handle The initial loading of the minimum amount of program data needed
to run.

This will also setup entire databases, based off of the database configuration files,
to promote loose couplings, the methods used to setup the database, will come from
models.database.api_adapters, in the case that we will need to insert into a different
database in the future.
