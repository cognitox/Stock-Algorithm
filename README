DATABASE LAYER:

The database layer will be driven by the setup module, wich inturn will contact the models.database.database Database
class, which will use api_adaptors, per the specific database, chosen be the config, database, database_config.xml file
which will point to the proper xml, schema files,

We will also need a one to one, object relational mapper, such as SQLAlchemy



 #Setting properties

#
# What is the goal out of using ant to automate my python development
# 1) I want to automate all my tests, without having to manually run them

# 2) I want to push this to a repository, without having to manually use git...

# 3) I want to view my tests online, and view my stocks real-time via website
#    Will use a github repository, and heroku, to create real time reports,

# 4) I also would like to document my framework, and ideas in reference to 
#    This project and how 

# 5) This is also going to have to transfer DB stuff, from development sqlite
#    To a more so trusted database source, and there should probabaly be a git 
#    Ignore file somewhere in here, to no push up the enviornment variable settings
