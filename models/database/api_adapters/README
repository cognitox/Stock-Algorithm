This is a read me file for api_adapters

api_adapters is supposed to promote loose couplings between 
the way the databases that we use and the methods from database that are implemented
because of this abstraction, different databases will be able to be used set per the 
database configuration file [ database_config.xml ],

todo :// need to come up with a way to further promote loose couplings between the way
the database is created and parsed.
